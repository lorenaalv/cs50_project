            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p><strong>Background:</strong> Buying on the Road was born from the idea that travelers often have difficulty tracking their purchases on the road. In a world where mobility is a part of our daily lives, we recognized a gap in the market -- the ability to track purchases while traveling. As travelers ourselves, we experienced firsthand the frustration of uncertain package deliveries. This sparked the idea for a platform that could offer real-time tracking for travelers' purchases.</p>
            <p><strong>Evolution:</strong> Since the formation of our project, Buying on the Road has grown from a simple idea into a fully-fledged application serving a diverse user base. We've stumbled across inveitable bumps in the road, but ultimately were able to meet our goal and create a website application that allowed you to view your purchases on the road! We are also continuously updating our platform with new features. Our application is a commitment to improving travel experiences.</p>
